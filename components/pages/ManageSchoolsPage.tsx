// FIX: Implemented the ManageSchoolsPage component which was a placeholder, resolving 'not a module' errors. It currently displays a placeholder page.
import React from 'react';
import PlaceholderPage from './PlaceholderPage';

const ManageSchoolsPage: React.FC = () => {
    return <PlaceholderPage title="Kelola Sekolah" />;
};

export default ManageSchoolsPage;
