-- PART 1: FIX PROFILES RLS
-- ========================================

-- 1. DROP semua existing policies yang mungkin restrictive
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can manage profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can manage profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public profiles readable by authenticated users" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin and Staff can manage all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can manage all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can manage their school profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can view their students" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Principals can view their school profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Foundation heads can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can view classmates and teachers" ON profiles;

-- 2. ENABLE RLS
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. CREATE SIMPLE POLICIES (NO RECURSION!)

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own profile"
ON profiles
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (id = auth.uid())
WITH CHECK (id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles"
ON profiles
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert profiles"
ON profiles
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update profiles"
ON profiles
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete profiles"
ON profiles
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- ========================================
-- PART 2: FIX CLASS_MEMBERS RLS
-- ========================================

-- 1. DROP semua existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin dan Staff dapat manage class_members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view class_members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can manage class_members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can manage all class members" ON class_members;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can manage their school class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can view their class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Principals can view their school class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Foundation heads can view all class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can view their own class members" ON class_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can view their classmates" ON class_members;

-- 2. ENABLE RLS
ALTER TABLE class_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. CREATE SIMPLE POLICIES (NO RECURSION!)

CREATE POLICY "Users can view class members"
ON class_members
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert class members"
ON class_members
FOR INSERT
